# Status Vocabularies

This file is the **single authoritative source** for status values used across
the harness. There are **three separate enums**. They describe different things
and MUST NOT be mixed or conflated.

| Enum | Question it answers | Where it is stored |
|---|---|---|
| Artifact lifecycle status | "Is this document current?" | `status:` in each artifact's front matter (`artifact-schema.md`) |
| Review verdict | "What did this automated stage decide?" | `result.verdict` in the stage result envelope |
| Workflow status | "What state is the delivery workflow in?" | `status:` / `pending_human_gate.status` in `workflow-state.yaml` |

---

## 1. Artifact lifecycle status

Applies to every story-level artifact (front-matter `status:` field).

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DRAFT` | Produced by its owner Skill; not yet reviewed or approved. |
| `IN_REVIEW` | A downstream review stage is currently evaluating it. |
| `APPROVED` | Passed its review gate (and human gate where one exists). Safe to consume downstream. |
| `SUPERSEDED` | A newer version exists. The newer artifact's `supersedes:` points here. Never used as a current input. |
| `ARCHIVED` | Belongs to a delivery that has completed archive mode. Retained for history only. |

Rules:
- A revised artifact increments `version:` and sets `supersedes:` to the prior path/version. The prior revision becomes `SUPERSEDED`.
- Reviewers MUST check that every input artifact they consumed is the current (non-`SUPERSEDED`, non-`ARCHIVED`) version and that its `version:` matches what downstream artifacts recorded consuming.
- Stale input (a review or evidence artifact generated from a now-`SUPERSEDED` upstream) blocks progression until the dependent stage is re-run.

## 2. Review verdict

The only values an automated stage Skill may emit in `result.verdict`.

| Value | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | Stage goal met. Zero blocking findings. May carry `non_blocking_findings`. | Advance to `stage-map.yaml` `next`. |
| `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | Correctable problem. The Skill sets `loop_back_stage` to a key defined under this stage's `loop_back` map. | Route to `loop_back_stage`. |
| `BLOCKED` | Stage cannot be evaluated: missing/stale mandatory input, unresolved blocking Open Decision, environment failure, artifact conflict. | Hold at current stage; surface `blocking_issues`; may require human decision. |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | Only for a stage marked `optional: true` whose `optional_when` condition is met and recorded. | Advance to `next`. |

Retired result values and their mapping (MUST NOT appear in any Skill):

| Retired | Canonical |
|---|---|
| `APPROVED` | `PASS` |
| `APPROVED_WITH_COMMENTS` | `PASS` with `non_blocking_findings` populated |
| `REJECTED` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` (correctable) or `BLOCKED` (not evaluable) |
| `READY_FOR_PLANNING` | `PASS` |
| `READY_FOR_PLANNING_WITH_RISKS` | `PASS` with `non_blocking_findings` |
| `IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_VERIFICATION` | `PASS` |
| `PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` (`loop_back_stage: IMPLEMENTATION`, key `partial`) |
| `FAILED` | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `BLOCKED` |
| `READY_FOR_PR` (as a verdict) | `PASS` at `PR_PREPARATION` |
| `READY_FOR_PR_WITH_COMMENTS` | `PASS` with `non_blocking_findings` |
| `PROCEED_TO_*` | derive the next stage from `stage-map.yaml`; do not name it in the Skill |
| `RETURN_TO_*` | use `loop_back_stage` with a key from `stage-map.yaml` |

Note: `READY_FOR_PR` and `COMPLETED` and `ARCHIVED` are also **workflow stages**
(`stage-map.yaml`). They are not verdicts. The verdict at `PR_PREPARATION` is
`PASS`; the orchestrator then advances the *stage* to `READY_FOR_PR`.

---

## 3. Workflow status

Stored in `workflow-state.yaml` (`status:` and inside `pending_human_gate`).

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NOT_STARTED` | Story activated; no stage has run. |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | An automated stage is the current stage and is runnable. |
| `WAITING_FOR_HUMAN` | Current stage is a `human_gate`; `pending_human_gate.status = PENDING`. |
| `BLOCKED` | Last stage returned `BLOCKED`, or a workflow invariant failed. |
| `COMPLETED` | Reached stage `COMPLETED` (human confirmed PR merged / delivery done). |
| `ARCHIVED` | Reached stage `ARCHIVED` via archive mode. |

`pending_human_gate.status` sub-enum: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.
