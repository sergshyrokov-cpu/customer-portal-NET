name: impact-analyzer
description: >
  Analyzes the expected impact of an approved User Story on the existing
  codebase, architecture, API, persistence model, tests, documentation,
  and configuration. Use after Specification and design artifacts are
  approved, but before creating an Implementation Plan.
---

# Purpose

Determine where and how an approved User Story is expected to affect the
existing system before implementation planning begins.

The result is a predictive analysis.

It describes the expected change surface based on currently available
requirements, designs, architecture documentation, and repository state.

It does not record the files that were actually changed during implementation.
Actual changes are captured later during Reconciliation.

---

# When To Use

Use this Skill when:

- a User Story has an approved Specification;
- required API and persistence designs exist;
- the team needs to understand the expected scope of change;
- an Implementation Plan has not yet been created;
- an existing codebase must be inspected before planning.

Typical requests:

- Analyze the impact of the active User Story.
- Identify affected modules, packages, classes, and artifacts.
- Determine the expected change surface for US-001.
- Prepare impact analysis before implementation planning.

---

# When Not To Use

Do not use this Skill:

- before the User Story has been clarified;
- while the Specification is rejected;
- instead of architecture design;
- instead of implementation planning;
- to generate implementation code;
- to determine the files actually changed after implementation;
- for unrelated repository-wide architecture assessment.

---

# Active Scope

Read:

- docs/workflow/active-story.yaml
- docs/workflow/workflow-state.yaml

Determine the active Story ID from the workflow artifacts.

Work only on the active User Story.

Do not analyze inactive backlog items unless explicitly requested.

If no active Story is defined, stop and report:

IMPACT_ANALYSIS_BLOCKED: No active User Story is configured.

---

# Canonical Sources

- Workflow / stage: `docs/workflow/stage-map.yaml` (`IMPACT_ANALYSIS`;
  loop_back keys `changes_required_specification`, `changes_required_api`,
  `changes_required_database`).
- Artifact paths: `docs/workflow/artifact-paths.yaml` — **authoritative**.
  Resolve every path below from its registry key. Paths shown are illustrative.
- Status vocabulary: `docs/workflow/artifact-lifecycle.md`.
- Front matter: `docs/workflow/artifact-schema.md`.

# Required Context

Read (registry keys, resolved via `artifact-paths.yaml`):

- `story`
- `specification`  (approved)
- `specification_review`
- `api_design`, `openapi`  (or their `NOT_APPLICABLE` record)
- `database_design`, `entity_model`  (or their `NOT_APPLICABLE` record)
- `design_review`
- `open_decisions`

Read project architecture documentation:

- docs/architecture/architecture.md
- docs/architecture/package-map.md
- docs/architecture/api-conventions.md
- docs/architecture/persistence-conventions.md
- docs/architecture/security-conventions.md

Read relevant product context:

- docs/product/business-rules.md
- docs/product/business-glossary.md
- docs/product/non-functional-requirements.md

(`open_decisions` is already listed in Required Context above.)

Read AGENTS.md before analyzing the repository.

---

# Preconditions

The Skill may proceed only when all mandatory conditions are satisfied.

## Specification

The `specification` must exist and be current (not `SUPERSEDED`).

The `specification_review` verdict must be `PASS`, and `HUMAN_SPEC_APPROVAL`
must be recorded (the orchestrator routes here only after that gate).

Do not proceed when the review verdict is `CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `BLOCKED`, or
when the review is missing.

## Design Artifacts

`design_review` must exist with verdict `PASS`.

The following must exist when relevant to the Story:

- `api_design`, `openapi`
- `database_design`, `entity_model`

A design area may be absent only when the Specification explicitly marks it
`NOT_APPLICABLE` (and `API_DESIGN` / `DB_DESIGN` recorded that verdict).

Record every consumed artifact's version in this analysis's `inputs` front
matter.

## Architecture Documentation

The following files must exist and contain meaningful project guidance:

- docs/architecture/architecture.md
- docs/architecture/package-map.md
- docs/architecture/api-conventions.md
- docs/architecture/persistence-conventions.md
- docs/architecture/security-conventions.md

An empty or placeholder-only architecture document is a blocker.

Do not infer missing architectural constraints from framework conventions.

## Open Decisions

Inspect all relevant artifacts for unresolved markers:

- Open Decision
- OPEN
- TODO
- TBD
- FIXME
- ???
- unresolved
- to be decided

If an unresolved decision can materially change the affected components,
stop the analysis and create a blocked Impact Analysis report.

Do not choose an answer on behalf of the developer.

---

# Tooling Strategy

Prefer semantic and IDE-aware analysis over plain-text matching.

## Preferred Rider MCP Capabilities

When available, use JetBrains Rider (IntelliJ-platform) MCP capabilities for:

- project module discovery;
- dependency inspection;
- symbol search;
- symbol information;
- call analysis;
- repository structure inspection;
- current file problems.

Preferred tools include:

- mcp__idea__get_project_modules
- mcp__idea__get_project_dependencies
- mcp__idea__list_directory_tree
- mcp__idea__search_symbol
- mcp__idea__get_symbol_info
- mcp__idea__analyze_calls
- mcp__idea__get_file_problems
- mcp__idea__get_repositories
- mcp__idea__git_status

Use only the tools required for the current analysis.

## Fallback Strategy

If the Rider MCP is unavailable:

1. Use built-in file discovery.
2. Use built-in text and pattern search.
3. Read only relevant source files.
4. Clearly record that semantic code analysis was unavailable.

Do not claim semantic certainty when only text search was used.

---

# Analysis Workflow

## Step 1: Resolve Active Story

Read the workflow state.

Determine:

- Story ID;
- current workflow stage;
- current artifact versions;
- current review status.

Verify that the expected stage allows Impact Analysis.

---

## Step 2: Validate Inputs

Check that all required artifacts exist.

Check:

- approval status;
- unresolved decisions;
- TODO and TBD markers;
- empty architecture references;
- conflicting sources.

If blocked, produce a blocked report and stop.

---

## Step 3: Extract Required Capabilities

From the User Story, Acceptance Criteria, and Specification, identify:

- business capabilities introduced or changed;
- API behavior introduced or changed;
- persistence behavior introduced or changed;
- security behavior introduced or changed;
- validation behavior introduced or changed;
- documentation and operational behavior introduced or changed.

Do not yet map these requirements to implementation steps.

---

## Step 4: Inspect Existing Architecture

Analyze:

- project structure;
- namespace responsibilities;
- dependency direction;
- architectural boundaries;
- existing conventions;
- existing extension points.

Determine which architectural areas own the affected responsibilities.

Do not create new layers or namespaces unless the existing architecture does
not provide an appropriate location.

If a new architectural decision is required, create an Open Decision instead
of silently adding a new structure.

---

## Step 5: Inspect Existing Codebase

Search for existing:

- controllers;
- services;
- repositories;
- entities;
- DTOs;
- validators;
- exception handlers;
- security configurations;
- configuration properties;
- tests;
- migrations or schema definitions;
- OpenAPI artifacts.

Prefer symbol-aware inspection when available.

Identify reusable components and existing patterns.

Avoid proposing duplicate abstractions when an existing component can be
extended safely.

---

## Step 6: Identify Expected Change Surface

Classify expected changes as:

- Create;
- Modify;
- Reuse;
- Remove;
- No Change;
- Unknown.

Analyze impact across:

### Modules

Which projects (in `CustomerPortal.sln`) or application modules are affected.

### Namespaces

Which namespace responsibilities are involved.

### Source Files

Likely files to create or modify.

### API

Endpoints, schemas, status codes, and error contracts.

### Persistence

Entities, attributes, constraints, indexes, and repository behavior.

### Security

Authentication, authorization, password handling, data exposure, and
configuration.

### Tests

Unit, integration, security, persistence, and contract tests.

### Configuration

Application properties, profiles, dependencies, and runtime configuration.

### Documentation

Specifications, API contracts, architecture documents, and operational
documentation.

---

## Step 7: Analyze Risks

Identify risks such as:

- architecture boundary violations;
- breaking API changes;
- persistence incompatibility;
- schema or data migration risk;
- security regression;
- missing validation;
- duplicated domain logic;
- impact outside the active Story;
- dependency changes;
- configuration changes;
- insufficient test coverage;
- unsupported assumptions.

Classify each risk as:

- Critical;
- Major;
- Minor.

---

## Step 8: Identify Human Decisions

List decisions that require human approval before planning.

Examples:

- introduction of a new dependency;
- change to namespace ownership;
- new architectural abstraction;
- backward-incompatible API change;
- schema migration strategy;
- authentication or authorization model;
- storage of sensitive information;
- behavior not defined by Acceptance Criteria.

Do not resolve these decisions automatically.

---

## Step 9: Produce Impact Analysis

Create the `impact_analysis` artifact at its registry path
(`docs/impact-analysis/{story_id}-impact-analysis.md`).

Do not modify source code.

Do not create the Implementation Plan (that is `implementation-planner`'s sole
output — this Skill owns `impact_analysis` and nothing else).

Do not update design artifacts.

---

# Output Format

The Impact Analysis uses the shared front matter from
`docs/workflow/artifact-schema.md` (`artifact_type: impact_analysis`), plus an
extension line `semantic_analysis: IDEA_MCP | TEXT_FALLBACK | UNAVAILABLE`.

`created_at` / `updated_at` are runtime timestamps — never hard-coded.
`status` starts `DRAFT`. `inputs[]` records each consumed artifact path + version
(especially `specification` and `specification_review`).

Illustrative front matter (dates are examples only):

```yaml
---
artifact_type: impact_analysis
story: US-001
version: 1
status: DRAFT
created_at: <runtime>
updated_at: <runtime>
produced_by: impact-analyzer
inputs:
  - path: docs/specifications/US-001-spec.md
    version: 1
  - path: docs/reviews/specifications/US-001-spec-review.md
    version: 1
  - path: docs/reviews/designs/US-001-design-review.md
    version: 1
supersedes: null
semantic_analysis: IDEA_MCP

```

# 1. Executive Summary

Summarize:

- change purpose;
- expected scope;
- affected architectural areas;
- overall risk.

# 2. Source Artifacts

List every artifact used in the analysis.

Include its path and relevant version or status.

# 3. Business Capability Impact

Describe which business capabilities are introduced, modified, or reused.

# 4. Module Impact

For every affected module, provide:

- module name;
- impact type;
- rationale;
- confidence.

# 5. Namespace Impact

For every affected namespace, provide:

- namespace;
- responsibility;
- impact type;
- rationale;
- architecture constraint.

# 6. Expected File Changes

Use separate sections:

## Files To Create
## Files To Modify
## Files To Reuse
## Files Potentially Affected

For each item provide:

- expected path;
- responsibility;
- reason;
- source requirement;
- confidence: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.

Do not present uncertain file paths as facts.

# 7. API Impact

Describe:

- new or modified operations;
- request and response impact;
- error behavior;
- compatibility concerns;
- relevant OpenAPI sections.

# 8. Persistence Impact

Describe:

- entities;
- fields;
- constraints;
- indexes;
- repository behavior;
- expected schema changes;
- migration implications.

For this training project, do not treat `EnsureCreated()`/`EnsureDeleted()`
against the file database as a replacement for explicit EF Core migrations.

# 9. Security Impact

Describe:

- authentication impact;
- authorization impact;
- sensitive data;
- password or credential handling;
- exposure risks;
- security configuration changes.

# 10. Testing Impact

List expected:

- unit tests;
- integration tests;
- security tests;
- persistence tests;
- API or contract tests.

Map testing areas to Acceptance Criteria.

# 11. Configuration and Dependency Impact

Identify:

- application configuration changes;
- NuGet dependency changes (`dotnet list package`);
- profile changes;
- runtime changes;
- external service changes.

New dependencies require explicit human approval.

# 12. Documentation Impact

List documentation that may need updates.

# 13. Risks

For every risk provide:

- severity;
- description;
- affected area;
- mitigation;
- human decision required.

# 14. Open Decisions

List unresolved decisions affecting planning.

If none exist, explicitly state:

No blocking Open Decisions were identified.

# 15. Planning Inputs

Provide a concise list of facts that the Implementation Planner must consume.

Do not convert these facts into implementation steps.

# 16. Traceability

Map:

- Acceptance Criterion;
- Specification section;
- Design artifact;
- affected system area;
- expected test category.

# 17. Analysis Limitations

State:

- unavailable tools;
- missing documents;
- low-confidence predictions;
- areas that require reanalysis.

# 18. Readiness Result

State the verdict and explain it. See the Result Envelope section below for the
mapping: a clean analysis is `PASS`; an analysis with residual risks is `PASS`
with `non_blocking_findings`; an un-analysable Story is `BLOCKED`; an analysis
that shows an upstream artifact must change is `CHANGES_REQUIRED` with a
loop-back.

---

# Result Envelope

Return exactly this; the story-orchestrator records the transition — this Skill
does not update `workflow-state.yaml`:

```yaml
result:
  verdict: PASS | CHANGES_REQUIRED | BLOCKED
  stage: IMPACT_ANALYSIS
  story: <StoryId>
  artifact_status: DRAFT
  artifacts:
    - docs/impact-analysis/<StoryId>-impact-analysis.md
  next_stage: IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING
  loop_back_stage: null
  blocking_issues: []
  non_blocking_findings: []
```

- `PASS` — the change surface is identified with acceptable confidence; residual
  risks (if any) are listed in `non_blocking_findings`.
- `CHANGES_REQUIRED` — analysis shows an approved upstream artifact is wrong or
  incomplete. Set `loop_back_stage` using a key from
  `stage-map.yaml` `IMPACT_ANALYSIS.loop_back`:
  `changes_required_specification` → `SPECIFICATION`,
  `changes_required_api` → `API_DESIGN`,
  `changes_required_database` → `DB_DESIGN`.
- `BLOCKED` — missing/stale mandatory input, empty architecture document, or a
  blocking Open Decision that could materially change the affected components.

---

# Confidence Rules

Use:

HIGH

The affected component exists and semantic or direct evidence confirms impact.

MEDIUM

The impact follows from approved design, but the final file or symbol does not yet exist.

LOW

The impact depends on unresolved architecture or implementation decisions.

Low-confidence findings must not silently become mandatory planning inputs.

---

# Boundaries

This Skill must not:

- modify source code;
- create tests;
- generate migration files;
- edit OpenAPI;
- create an Implementation Plan;
- approve architecture changes;
- resolve Open Decisions;
- change workflow stage automatically;
- create commits or Pull Requests;
- inspect unrelated features;
- treat predicted files as actual changes.

---

# Failure Handling

If required inputs are missing:

1. Create a BLOCKED Impact Analysis report.
2. List missing artifacts.
3. Explain why they are required.
4. Do not continue with partial assumptions.

If the Rider MCP fails:

1. Record the failure.
2. Use built-in repository inspection where possible.
3. Mark semantic_analysis as TEXT_FALLBACK.
4. Reduce confidence where semantic confirmation was required.

If architecture documents are empty:

1. Set status to BLOCKED.
2. List the empty documents.
3. Request architecture context.
4. Do not invent namespace ownership or dependency rules.

---

# Completion Criteria

The Skill is complete only when:

- active Story is identified;
- required artifacts are validated;
- architecture documentation is inspected;
- existing codebase is inspected;
- affected areas are classified;
- expected files are separated from uncertain candidates;
- API, persistence, security, tests, and configuration are covered;
- risks and Open Decisions are documented;
- traceability is provided;
- readiness result is explicit;
- Impact Analysis artifact is saved.

The Skill result is a proposal for planning.

It must later be compared with actual changes during Reconciliation.
