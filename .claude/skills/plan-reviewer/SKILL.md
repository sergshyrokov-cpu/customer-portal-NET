name: plan-reviewer
description: >
  Reviews an implementation plan for completeness, feasibility, architectural
  compliance, scope control, traceability, testing coverage, and security.
  Use after an implementation plan has been created and before tests or
  implementation work begins.
---

# Purpose

Determine whether the proposed Implementation Plan is safe, complete,
reviewable, and ready for execution.

The Skill reviews the plan against approved requirements, designs, predicted
impact, project architecture, and engineering constraints.

The Skill does not implement the plan and does not silently correct it.

When problems are found, the Skill produces actionable review findings and
identifies the workflow stage to which the Story should return.

---

# When To Use

Use this Skill when:

- the active Story has an approved Specification;
- API and database designs exist when required;
- Impact Analysis has completed;
- an Implementation Plan has been created;
- tests and implementation have not started;
- a plan must pass a quality gate before execution.

Typical requests:

- Review the implementation plan for the active Story.
- Validate the US-001 plan before implementation.
- Check whether this plan is ready for test writing and execution.
- Review the plan against the Specification and Impact Analysis.

---

# When Not To Use

Do not use this Skill:

- to create an Implementation Plan;
- before Impact Analysis is available;
- to implement code;
- to generate tests;
- to rewrite approved requirements;
- to resolve Open Decisions;
- to review the implementation after coding;
- as a replacement for human approval when one is required.

---

# Active Scope

Read:

- docs/workflow/active-story.yaml
- docs/workflow/workflow-state.yaml

Determine:

- active Story ID;
- current workflow stage;
- active artifact versions;
- expected plan review stage.

Work only on the active Story unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

If no active Story is configured, stop and report:

PLAN_REVIEW_BLOCKED: No active User Story is configured.

---

# Canonical Sources

- Workflow / stage: `docs/workflow/stage-map.yaml` (`PLAN_REVIEW`; loop_back key
  `changes_required` → `IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING`).
- Artifact paths: `docs/workflow/artifact-paths.yaml` — **authoritative**.
  Resolve every path from its registry key. Paths shown are illustrative.
- Status vocabulary: `docs/workflow/artifact-lifecycle.md`.
- Front matter: `docs/workflow/artifact-schema.md`.

# Required Context

Read (registry keys, resolved via `artifact-paths.yaml`):

- `story`
- `specification`, `specification_review`
- `impact_analysis`
- `implementation_plan`
- `api_design`, `openapi`, `database_design`, `entity_model`
  (or their `NOT_APPLICABLE` record)
- `design_review`
- `open_decisions`

Read architecture references:

- docs/architecture/architecture.md
- docs/architecture/package-map.md
- docs/architecture/api-conventions.md
- docs/architecture/persistence-conventions.md
- docs/architecture/security-conventions.md

Read product-level constraints:

- docs/product/business-rules.md
- docs/product/non-functional-requirements.md

(`open_decisions` is listed in Required Context above.)

Read AGENTS.md before starting the review.

---

# Preconditions

## Specification

`specification_review` verdict must be `PASS`, and `HUMAN_SPEC_APPROVAL` must be
recorded.

Do not proceed when the review verdict is `CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `BLOCKED`, or
when the review is missing.

## Design Review

`design_review` must exist with verdict `PASS`.

## Impact Analysis

`impact_analysis` must exist with verdict `PASS`, current version.

Do not proceed when it is `BLOCKED` or missing.

## Human Plan Approval

This stage runs **before** `HUMAN_PLAN_APPROVAL`. The plan being reviewed is
`DRAFT`; a `PASS` here sends it to that human gate.

## Implementation Plan

The Implementation Plan must exist and contain meaningful steps.

An empty or placeholder-only plan is a blocker.

## Open Decisions

Inspect all required artifacts for unresolved markers:

- Open Decision
- OPEN
- TODO
- TBD
- FIXME
- ???
- unresolved
- to be decided

An unresolved decision is blocking when it affects:

- public API behavior;
- persistence design;
- security behavior;
- architecture;
- Acceptance Criteria;
- test expectations;
- dependency selection;
- execution order.

Do not resolve Open Decisions during plan review.

---

# Review Principles

## Requirements Before Implementation Preference

The plan must implement approved requirements.

The plan must not introduce new business behavior.

## Contract Before Code

When the Story changes API behavior, the plan must reference the approved
OpenAPI contract.

## Persistence Design Before Persistence Code

When the Story changes persistence behavior, the plan must reference the
approved database design.

## Tests Before or With Implementation

The plan must define tests before the corresponding implementation is
considered complete.

## Minimal Scope

The plan must avoid unrelated refactoring and opportunistic improvements.

## Reviewable Increments

The plan should be structured into small, ordered, verifiable steps.

## Evidence Before Completion

Every significant implementation step should have a corresponding validation
activity or observable completion criterion.

---

# Tooling Strategy

Use documentation artifacts as the primary source of approved intent.

Use the Rider (IntelliJ-platform) MCP to verify claims about the existing
repository when available.

Preferred Rider MCP capabilities include:

- mcp__idea__get_project_modules
- mcp__idea__get_project_dependencies
- mcp__idea__list_directory_tree
- mcp__idea__search_symbol
- mcp__idea__get_symbol_info
- mcp__idea__analyze_calls
- mcp__idea__get_file_problems

Use semantic analysis selectively.

Do not inspect the entire repository when the plan and Impact Analysis identify
a bounded change surface.

If the Rider MCP is unavailable:

1. Use built-in file discovery and search.
2. Read only relevant files.
3. Record that semantic verification was unavailable.
4. Lower confidence for findings that require semantic confirmation.

---

# Review Workflow

## Step 1: Resolve Active Story

Read workflow state and determine:

- Story ID;
- current stage;
- plan version;
- Impact Analysis version;
- Specification version.

Confirm that the workflow is currently at PLAN_REVIEW or an equivalent stage.

---

## Step 2: Validate Artifact Chain

Verify that the plan references the current approved versions of:

- User Story;
- Specification;
- Specification Review;
- API Design;
- Database Design;
- Impact Analysis.

Flag stale or superseded inputs.

The plan must not be approved if it was created from outdated artifacts.

---

## Step 3: Verify Scope Alignment

Compare the plan with:

- User Story;
- Acceptance Criteria;
- Specification;
- explicit Out of Scope statements.

Identify:

- missing required behavior;
- unsupported additions;
- unrelated changes;
- hidden scope expansion;
- speculative abstractions.

---

## Step 4: Verify Impact Analysis Coverage

For every HIGH-confidence and MEDIUM-confidence affected area in Impact
Analysis, determine whether the plan:

- addresses it;
- explicitly excludes it with justification;
- postpones it through an approved decision;
- accidentally ignores it.

The plan may differ from Impact Analysis, but every material difference must be
explicitly explained.

---

## Step 5: Verify Architecture Compliance

Check:

- Controller, Service, and Repository responsibilities;
- dependency direction;
- namespace ownership;
- entity and DTO separation;
- placement of validation logic;
- exception handling approach;
- configuration boundaries;
- reuse of existing components.

Flag:

- direct Controller-to-Repository access;
- business logic in Controllers;
- persistence logic outside the Repository layer;
- transport DTOs used as persistence entities;
- new packages without architectural justification;
- duplicated responsibilities.

---

## Step 6: Verify API Plan

When API behavior changes, check that the plan includes:

- OpenAPI update or confirmed approved contract;
- endpoint implementation;
- request and response model handling;
- validation behavior;
- error mapping;
- authentication and authorization;
- contract tests;
- compatibility considerations.

The plan must not invent API behavior not present in the approved design.

---

## Step 7: Verify Persistence Plan

When persistence behavior changes, check that the plan includes:

- entity changes;
- explicit constraints;
- nullability;
- length limits;
- uniqueness;
- indexes when required;
- repository behavior;
- schema initialization or migration implications;
- persistence tests.

For this training project, SQLite file persistence may be used.

The plan must not rely on `EnsureCreated()`/`EnsureDeleted()` against the file
database as a substitute for explicit EF Core migrations and constraint
design.

---

## Step 8: Verify Security Plan

Check that the plan addresses relevant security requirements, including:

- password hashing;
- password exposure prevention;
- authentication boundaries;
- authorization boundaries;
- input validation;
- sensitive data logging;
- database admin/diagnostic UI exposure;
- insecure development-only configuration;
- secret management.

If the Story handles passwords, credentials, tokens, personal data, or account
state, absence of an explicit security step is a blocking finding.

---

## Step 9: Verify Testing Strategy

Map each Acceptance Criterion to at least one planned verification method.

Review expected coverage across:

- unit tests;
- web-layer tests;
- integration tests;
- persistence tests;
- security tests;
- contract tests;
- negative scenarios.

Flag tests that merely reproduce implementation structure without validating
observable behavior.

---

## Step 10: Verify Execution Order

Check whether the implementation sequence respects dependencies.

A typical order may include:

1. Contract and artifact confirmation.
2. Test preparation.
3. Persistence changes.
4. Service behavior.
5. API or controller behavior.
6. Security integration.
7. Build and diagnostics.
8. Full verification.
9. Documentation reconciliation.

This order is guidance, not a mandatory template.

Approve a different order when the plan explains why it is safer or more
efficient.

---

## Step 11: Verify Validation Steps

Each significant step should define how its result will be checked.

Planned evidence may include:

- `dotnet build` result;
- test result;
- Rider diagnostics;
- lint or inspection result;
- OpenAPI validation;
- security review;
- traceability report.

A plan that ends with an unverified statement such as "ensure everything
works" is not ready.

---

## Step 12: Review Change Size

Determine whether the plan is reasonably reviewable as one Pull Request.

Flag:

- excessive file count;
- unrelated modules;
- unnecessary dependency additions;
- broad refactoring;
- multiple independent capabilities;
- changes that should be split into separate stories or Pull Requests.

Do not split scope automatically.

Recommend a human decision when decomposition is needed.

---

## Step 13: Classify Findings

Classify each finding as:

### Critical

Blocks plan approval.

Examples:

- unresolved requirement;
- missing Acceptance Criterion coverage;
- security requirement omitted;
- contradiction with approved design;
- stale Specification;
- unsupported scope expansion.

### Major

Requires plan correction before implementation.

Examples:

- incomplete test strategy;
- affected component omitted;
- unclear execution order;
- non-reviewable step;
- missing validation evidence.

### Minor

Improves clarity or maintainability but does not block execution.

Examples:

- naming consistency;
- additional explanation;
- optional optimization;
- documentation refinement.

---

## Step 14: Determine Loop-Back Target

`stage-map.yaml` defines exactly one loop-back for `PLAN_REVIEW`:
`changes_required` → `IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING`.

For every Critical or Major finding, identify the earliest stage that could
correct it. If that stage is upstream of `IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING`
(a Specification / design / impact-analysis defect), the plan cannot be fixed by
re-planning alone: return `verdict: BLOCKED` and name the upstream stage in
`blocking_issues` so a human can route it. Otherwise return
`verdict: CHANGES_REQUIRED` with `loop_back_stage: IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING`.

Do not send trivial issues back; use `non_blocking_findings` for `Minor` items.

---

## Step 15: Produce Plan Review

Create the `plan_review` artifact at its registry path
(`docs/reviews/plans/{story_id}-plan-review.md`), front matter per
`docs/workflow/artifact-schema.md` (`artifact_type: plan_review`).

Do not modify the Implementation Plan. Do not update workflow state.

---

# Output Format

Use the following structure.

## Front Matter

Shared block from `docs/workflow/artifact-schema.md`
(`artifact_type: plan_review`), plus finding counts. `created_at` / `updated_at`
are runtime timestamps. Illustrative (dates are examples only):

    ---
    artifact_type: plan_review
    story: US-001
    version: 1
    status: DRAFT
    created_at: <runtime>
    updated_at: <runtime>
    produced_by: plan-reviewer
    inputs:
      - path: docs/plans/US-001-implementation-plan.md
        version: 1
      - path: docs/specifications/US-001-spec.md
        version: 1
      - path: docs/impact-analysis/US-001-impact-analysis.md
        version: 1
    supersedes: null
    critical_findings: 0
    major_findings: 0
    minor_findings: 0

Do not rewrite the plan.

## 17. Verdict Rationale

Explain the verdict (see Result Envelope). Do not use `PROCEED_TO_*` /
`RETURN_TO_*` labels — they are retired.

---

# Result Envelope

Return exactly this; the story-orchestrator records the transition (this Skill
does not update `workflow-state.yaml`):

```yaml
result:
  verdict: PASS | CHANGES_REQUIRED | BLOCKED
  stage: PLAN_REVIEW
  story: <StoryId>
  artifact_status: APPROVED        # of the plan_review artifact itself
  artifacts:
    - docs/reviews/plans/<StoryId>-plan-review.md
  next_stage: HUMAN_PLAN_APPROVAL
  loop_back_stage: null            # or IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING
  blocking_issues: []
  non_blocking_findings: []
```

- `PASS` — no Critical or Major findings; every Acceptance Criterion covered;
  security and validation sufficient; the plan is executable and reviewable as
  one Pull Request. Minor findings go in `non_blocking_findings`. The
  orchestrator then advances to `HUMAN_PLAN_APPROVAL`.
- `CHANGES_REQUIRED` — Critical or Major findings that re-planning can fix;
  `loop_back_stage: IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING`.
- `BLOCKED` — mandatory artifact missing/stale; blocking Open Decision;
  architecture documentation unavailable; an upstream (Specification / design /
  impact-analysis) defect the plan cannot resolve — name the upstream stage in
  `blocking_issues`; or the plan cannot be evaluated reliably.

---

# Boundaries

This Skill must not:

- edit the Implementation Plan;
- generate source code or tests;
- alter OpenAPI, designs, or the Specification;
- resolve Open Decisions;
- update workflow state (the orchestrator does that);
- create a branch, commit, or Pull Request;
- approve its own generated plan;
- replace the `HUMAN_PLAN_APPROVAL` gate.

---

# Failure Handling

If the plan is missing:

1. Create a `plan_review` artifact with the review context.
2. Record the missing path in `blocking_issues`.
3. Return `verdict: BLOCKED` (a missing plan is not something plan review can
   route; the orchestrator holds at `PLAN_REVIEW` / `IMPLEMENTATION_PLANNING`).
4. Stop.

If an input artifact is stale (a downstream artifact recorded an older upstream
version):

1. Identify the version mismatch.
2. Return `verdict: BLOCKED`; name the stale artifact in `blocking_issues`.
3. Recommend regeneration of the dependent artifacts.
4. Stop before detailed approval.

If the Rider MCP is unavailable:

1. Continue with document and file-based review where possible.
2. Record the unavailable semantic verification.
3. Avoid unsupported claims about symbol relationships.
4. Downgrade affected findings to lower confidence where appropriate.

---

# Completion Criteria

Plan Review is complete only when:

- active Story is identified;
- artifact versions are validated;
- scope is checked;
- Acceptance Criteria are traced;
- Impact Analysis coverage is checked;
- architecture is reviewed;
- API impact is reviewed;
- persistence impact is reviewed;
- security is reviewed;
- testing and validation are reviewed;
- execution order is reviewed;
- change size is assessed;
- findings are classified;
- loop-back target is assigned when the verdict is `CHANGES_REQUIRED`;
- the `plan_review` artifact is saved;
- the result envelope is returned with an explicit `verdict`.

Test writing and implementation must not begin when the verdict is
`CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `BLOCKED`, and only begin after `HUMAN_PLAN_APPROVAL`.
