description: Produces the OpenAPI contract and API design notes from an approved Specification. Owns the API_DESIGN stage.
---

# Purpose

Own the **API_DESIGN** stage. Produce the authoritative HTTP contract the
implementation must follow.

# Canonical sources

- Workflow / stage: `docs/workflow/stage-map.yaml` (`API_DESIGN`;
  `optional: true` when the approved Specification says the Story does not change
  public API behavior).
- Artifact paths: `docs/workflow/artifact-paths.yaml` — **authoritative**.
  Resolve `specification`, `specification_review`, `open_decisions`,
  `api_design`, `openapi`.
- Front matter: `docs/workflow/artifact-schema.md` (Markdown block for
  `api_design`; OpenAPI `x-` extension keys for `openapi` — see that file).
- Result vocabulary: `docs/workflow/artifact-lifecycle.md`.
- Conventions: `docs/architecture/api-conventions.md`,
  `docs/architecture/security-conventions.md`.

# Inputs (registry keys)

- `specification`, `specification_review`, `open_decisions`
- `docs/product/business-rules.md`, `docs/product/business-glossary.md`,
  `docs/product/non-functional-requirements.md`
- `docs/architecture/api-conventions.md`,
  `docs/architecture/security-conventions.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

# Preconditions

- `specification_review` verdict is `PASS` and `HUMAN_SPEC_APPROVAL` is
  recorded (the orchestrator routes here only after that gate).
- `specification` is the current (non-`SUPERSEDED`) version; record its version
  in this artifact's `inputs`.
- No blocking Open Decision affecting API behavior.

If the Specification explicitly states no public API change: emit
`verdict: NOT_APPLICABLE`, record the reason, produce no contract.

# Design responsibilities

Define per the Specification and `api-conventions.md`:

- resources, paths (plural nouns), HTTP methods, media type, API version;
- request DTO schemas, response DTO schemas (never entities; no credential
  fields);
- status codes per Acceptance Criterion;
- validation constraints (mirrored from the Specification);
- error responses (400 / 401 / 403 / 404 / 409 as applicable) using the
  structured error body from `api-conventions.md`;
- authentication and authorization per operation, consistent with
  `security-conventions.md`;
- pagination where a collection can grow (per `api-conventions.md`);
- compatibility notes for any change to an existing contract.

# Outputs

- `openapi` (`docs/designs/api/{story_id}-openapi.yaml`) — the contract, with
  `info.version` and `x-story` / `x-source-specification` /
  `x-source-specification-version` / `x-produced-by` keys per
  `artifact-schema.md`.
- `api_design` (`docs/designs/api/{story_id}-api-design.md`) — the Markdown
  companion (traceability anchor) with full front matter
  (`artifact_type: api_design`): rationale, operation-by-operation notes,
  Acceptance-Criterion → operation map, auth model, error model, open questions.

# Result Envelope

Return exactly this; the story-orchestrator records the transition:

```yaml
result:
  verdict: PASS | BLOCKED | NOT_APPLICABLE
  stage: API_DESIGN
  story: <StoryId>
  artifact_status: DRAFT
  artifacts:
    - docs/designs/api/<StoryId>-openapi.yaml
    - docs/designs/api/<StoryId>-api-design.md
  next_stage: DB_DESIGN
  loop_back_stage: null
  blocking_issues: []
  non_blocking_findings: []
```

- `PASS` — contract covers every API-relevant Acceptance Criterion; auth,
  validation, and error responses documented.
- `NOT_APPLICABLE` — Specification says no API change; reason recorded.
- `BLOCKED` — missing/stale Specification, blocking Open Decision, empty
  `api-conventions.md`, or an upstream artifact that makes a correct contract
  impossible. `API_DESIGN` has no `loop_back` map in `stage-map.yaml`; name the
  offending upstream stage in `blocking_issues` and let the human decide whether
  to reopen it. Do not emit `CHANGES_REQUIRED` at this stage.

# Prohibited

- Do not implement endpoints or write code.
- Do not resolve Open Decisions.
- Do not change the Specification.
- Do not update workflow state.
