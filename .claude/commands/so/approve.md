$ARGUMENTS

Requirements:

- read docs/workflow/workflow-state.yaml; the current_stage MUST be a stage
  whose type is `human_gate` in docs/workflow/stage-map.yaml
  (HUMAN_SPEC_APPROVAL, HUMAN_PLAN_APPROVAL, HUMAN_PR_APPROVAL, READY_FOR_PR,
  COMPLETED). If it is not, refuse and report the current stage;
- confirm every artifact in the gate's `required_artifacts` exists, is current
  (not SUPERSEDED / ARCHIVED), and its recorded automated verdict is PASS with
  no blocking findings; if not, refuse and report what is missing;
- set pending_human_gate.status = APPROVED, decided_at (runtime), decided_by;
  store the comment;
- append a docs/workflow/history.jsonl event with verdict "HUMAN_APPROVED";
- advance current_stage to the gate's `on_approve` target; clear
  pending_human_gate; set workflow status to IN_PROGRESS, or COMPLETED /
  ARCHIVED when entering those stages;
- do not invoke any stage Skill;
- do not create, push, or merge a Pull Request;
- finish with the Orchestration Result.
